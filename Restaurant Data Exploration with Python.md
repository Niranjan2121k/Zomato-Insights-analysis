# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Data Exploration with Python

## üìã Overview

This portfolio project dives into a curated restaurant dataset to understand how restaurant type, online‚Äëordering availability, customer ratings, pricing, and voting behaviour intertwine. Using Python (`pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`), I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built seven key visualisations that highlight actionable patterns for restaurant owners, aggregators, and diners alike.

### 1. Count of Listings by Type

![](1.png)

This bar chart shows the distribution of restaurant listings across four categories: **Dining**, **Cafes**, **Buffet**, and **Other**. 

- **Dining** dominates the dataset with over 100 listings, indicating it's the most common restaurant type in this sample.
- **Cafes** follow with a moderate count, while **Buffet** and **Other** types have significantly fewer entries.

üìå **Insight**: The high number of Dining listings suggests a preference or market saturation in this category. Restaurant platforms or new entrants might consider targeting underrepresented segments like Buffets or niche formats to stand out.
